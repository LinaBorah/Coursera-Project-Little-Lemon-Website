### Title: Little Lemon Website
### Feature: Booking a Table in the website

How to run: Clone it on your desktop, run npm install in the command line to install the node modules, and then npm start to actually see the website.

This website is an SPA(single page application) built in react.
This is a prototype of booking a table in a restaurant website. It includes a working home page, a reservation page, about page and header and footer.
I tried to semantically arrange the website.
Basically there is a button on the homepage, by clicking which user gets directed to a form to fill the details of the booking and then can confirm the booking.
Main component is the main page from where I have routed other pages. In this component I have handled the states.
